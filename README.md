# Symfony Demo Application to deploy on Google Cloud Run using Terraform

This Symfony demo application illustrates my blog post about deploying a [Symfony application on Google Cloud Run using Terraform](https://brice.mancone.fr/2020/05/19/symfony-google-cloud-run-terraform.html).

This is not a reference app. It is deliberately very simple but might be improved over time. 

Feel free to contribute : open an issue or submit PRs.

## Run locally using docker-compose

Start the service using : 

``` 
docker-compose up -d
```

The app is available at `http://localhost:8080`.
